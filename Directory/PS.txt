The computer OS uses an organizational unit called “directory” to organize folders and files into a hierarchical structure. 
A directory contains multiple files and other directories, and it provides a user with a logical file group. 
 
A directory uses “/” as a separator character and shows its route within the file system. 
“/” may represent a root directory or a hierarchical relationship between parent directories and subdirectories. 
For instance, “/aa/bb/” indicates that under the root directory, there is the “aa” directory, beneath which lies the “bb” directory. 

There are various features related to a directory, but you will implement the following 5 features in this problem:  	

- Create a directory  
- Remove a directory 
- Copy a directory 
- Move a directory 
- Check the number of subdirectories
